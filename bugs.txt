[zookd.c:65]
The 'reqpath' value gets read from HTTP request path without any overflow
checks in 'url_decode'. Thus with a long HTTP request path we can trigger
a buffer overflow, for example "GET /" + (2048 * 'X') + " HTTP/1.0\r\n".
The vulnerability can be prevented using stack canaries since overflowing the
'reqpath' buffer would write over the canary as well.

    char reqpath[2048];

    sprintf(envvar, "HTTP_%s", buf);
